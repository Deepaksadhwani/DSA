# Problem Statement:

# Generate and print the multiplication tables(only 10) for the numbers 2, 3, and 4  using loops. Each table should be space-separated integers, and each table should start on a new line.

# The tables should be printed up to the 10th multiple.

# Input Format:
# No specific input is required as the tables are predefined for 2, 3, and 4.
# Output Format:

# Print the multiplication tables for 2, 3, and 4, each up to the 10th multiple. Each table should be space-separated integers, and each table should start on a new line.

# Output :

# 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
# 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
# 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40
